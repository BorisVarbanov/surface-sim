    """
    biased_prefactors Return a biased channel prefactors.

    The bias of the channel is defined as any error operator that
    applied the biased Pauli operator on any qubit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    biased_pauli : str
        The biased Pauli operator, represented as a string
    biased_factor : float
        The strength of the bias.

        A bias factor of 1 corresponds to a standard depolarizing channel.
        A bias factor of 0 leads to no probability of biased errors occurring.
        A bias channel tending towards infinify (but inf not supported) leads to
        only the biased errors occurring.
    num_qubits : int
        The number of qubits in the channel.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        The array of prefactors
